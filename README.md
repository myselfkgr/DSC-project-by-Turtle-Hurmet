Student performance analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student performance using Python and the Student-Mat dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes various academic, demographic, and social factors for 649 students. The analysis begins with data preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and scaling features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is then performed using histograms, box plots, pie charts, and correlation matrices to identify patterns and relationships in the data. Clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical clustering help uncover natural groupings among students based on academic performance. Finally, three machine learning classification algorithms—Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine—are implemented and compared. The Decision Tree Classifier emerged as the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 77%. This project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can be used to gain valuable insights and improve educational outcomes through predictive modeling.
